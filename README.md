## Quick Guide üöÄ

### Building with Next.js

1. **Setup Next.js Project:**
   - Install Node.js and npm if you haven't.
   - Initialize a new project using the Next.js boilerplate:
     ```
     npx create-next-app crypto-metadata-explorer
     cd crypto-metadata-explorer
     ```

2. **Data Fetching:**
   - Use the `getServerSideProps` function in your desired page component for server-side rendering, fetching data from the Mobula API endpoint.
     ```javascript
     export async function getServerSideProps() {
       const res = await fetch('https://api.app-mobula.com/api/1/metadata');
       const data = await res.json();
       return { props: { data } };
     }
     ```

3. **UI Components and Display:**
   - Create reusable components for asset listings, metadata details, and market metrics.
   - Use packages like `styled-components` for styling and `react-query` for state management and data fetching.
   
4. **Filters and Search:**
   - Implement filters by categorizing data. Utilize state and effects to manage and apply filters dynamically.
   - Incorporate a search bar functionality, perhaps using libraries like `react-search-box` for enhanced search experiences.

5. **Optimizing Performance:**
   - Given the vast amount of data, consider implementing pagination or an "infinite scroll" feature. Libraries like `react-infinite-scroll-component` can be helpful.
   - Also, consider employing a caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls and boost performance.
